# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Training Management System to ensure it's safe for public deployment.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Supabase Auth Integration**: Secure user authentication with JWT tokens
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin and user roles with different permissions
- **Protected Routes**: Components wrapped with authentication checks
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic token refresh

### 2. Database Security
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access control policies
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own data
- **Admin Privileges**: Admins can access all data with proper authentication
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries through Supabase client

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Client-Side Validation**: Form input validation before submission
- **Email Validation**: Regex-based email format validation
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 6 character password requirement
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization and proper React rendering

### 4. Environment Security
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in `.env` files
- **Git Ignore**: Environment files excluded from version control
- **Docker Security**: Container security hardening with read-only filesystem
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All credentials removed from source code

### 5. Network Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Nginx configuration for secure connections
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin request handling
- **Security Headers**: XSS protection, content type options, frame options
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection through Supabase

### 6. Container Security
- **Docker Security**: No new privileges, read-only filesystem
- **Temporary Filesystems**: Volatile storage for logs and cache
- **Health Checks**: Container health monitoring
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU constraints

## Security Policies

### User Access Levels

#### Regular Users
- View their own profile and data
- Manage their own subscriptions
- Mark their own attendance
- View available trainings

#### Admin Users
- Access to all user data
- Create and manage trainings
- Manage user voucher balances
- View system-wide statistics

### Data Access Rules

#### Users Table
- Users can only view their own profile
- Admins can view and manage all users
- Email addresses are unique and validated

#### Trainings Table
- Public read access for all authenticated users
- Only admins can create, update, or delete trainings

#### Subscriptions Table
- Users can only manage their own subscriptions
- Admins can view and manage all subscriptions

#### Attendance Table
- Users can only manage their own attendance
- Admins can view and manage all attendance records

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
3. **Validate all user inputs** before processing
4. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing system details
5. **Regular security audits** of dependencies

### For Deployment
1. **Use strong passwords** for admin accounts
2. **Enable HTTPS** in production environments
3. **Regular backups** of database and configuration
4. **Monitor access logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Keep dependencies updated** to latest secure versions

### For Users
1. **Use strong passwords** (minimum 6 characters)
2. **Don't share credentials** with others
3. **Sign out** when using shared devices
4. **Report suspicious activity** to administrators

## Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All hardcoded credentials removed
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database RLS policies enabled
- [ ] Authentication system tested
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (production)
- [ ] Admin user created and tested

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor access logs
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Verify admin access controls
- [ ] Check security headers
- [ ] Validate user isolation
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity

## Incident Response

### Security Breach Response
1. **Immediate Action**: Disable affected accounts/services
2. **Investigation**: Review logs and identify breach scope
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Recovery**: Restore from secure backups
5. **Post-Incident**: Update security measures and document lessons
