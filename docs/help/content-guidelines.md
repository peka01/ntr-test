# Help Content Guidelines

## Content Management Standards

### Language Priority
- **Swedish is the master language** - All content should be written in Swedish first
- **English is secondary** - English versions should be translated from Swedish
- **Keep both versions in sync** - When updating one language, update the other

## Information Types and Structure

### Different Levels of Information

When writing help texts, we work with different types of topics/levels of information. The basic "start kit level" should include **Concept** and **Instruction** information types. Additional types are added based on complexity and user needs.

### 1. Concept Pages

**Purpose:** Serve as introduction to an area and can be used as landing pages when linking from external sites.

**Content should help readers understand:**
- If the feature is suitable for their task
- Any prerequisites to consider
- What to do next (next steps or related features)

**Structure:**
- Clear introduction to the main purpose
- How it relates to other parts of the system
- Best practice workflows (illustrations can complement text)
- Prerequisites and requirements

**Example:** System overview, voucher system explanation

### 2. Instructions

**Purpose:** Guide readers through performing specific tasks in the software.

**Structure:**
1. **Brief preamble** - Explain purpose and specify prerequisites
2. **Numbered action points** - Step-by-step instructions
3. **Use imperative mood** - "Click", "Select", "Enter" (not "You click", "You select")
4. **Combine minor steps** - Group related actions in one major step

**Interface Text Guidelines:**
- Make interface texts **bold**
- Use exact wording from the interface
- Initial letter in uppercase
- Example: "Select **Sales** - **Sales invoices** - **New sales invoice**"

**Additional Information:**
- Use info boxes for non-action information
- Distinguish between "need to know" vs "nice to know"
- Keep instructions focused and not too lengthy

### 3. Field Explanations

**Purpose:** Explain specific fields, buttons, or settings.

**Content should explain:**
- What the field/term means
- Whether it's relevant to use
- What information to enter
- Consequences/benefits of filling it out
- Where information comes from (if auto-filled)

**Note:** Only explain fields that are not self-explanatory in the interface.

### 4. Checklists

**Purpose:** Guide through processes involving multiple instructions across different parts of the system.

**Structure:**
- Can be standalone topics or part of concept topics
- Include instructions as steps or link to separate instruction topics
- Focus on "what and why" for each step

### 5. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

**Purpose:** Provide quick answers to common questions and help users narrow down problems.

**Content should:**
1. Answer common "hang-ups" (Where do I find...? How do I...? When should I...?)
2. Help users phrase their questions and find more information
3. Provide links to detailed topics (not full instructions)

**Header format:** Write as questions
- "How do I delete an invoice?"
- "Why can't I access the user settings?"

### 6. Troubleshooting/Problem Solving

**Purpose:** Guide users to correct mistakes and solve problems.

**Structure:**
- Separate from instructions (don't mix with "how to do it right")
- Focus on correcting specific mistakes
- Header should be a statement describing the problem

**Header format:** Write as problem statements
- "I have entered an incorrect date on an unpaid invoice"
- "I have posted an invoice to the ledger by mistake"
