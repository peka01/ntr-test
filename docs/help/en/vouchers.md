# Vouchers - Your ticket to trainings

## What are vouchers?

Think of vouchers as tickets to trainings – simple and clear. Each training costs one card. It makes it easy to keep track of who's joining what, and gives you control over training usage.

## How it works

### When you start
As a new user, you start with 0 vouchers. That's completely normal! You get cards from an administrator before you can participate in trainings.

### Registration vs attendance
- **Register for free**: Sign up for as many trainings as you want – no card is used
- **Attendance costs**: One card is deducted only when you actually mark attendance

### Get cards back
Cancel your attendance and you get the card back immediately. It's that simple!

## Important rules

### You need cards to participate
- Without cards you can't mark attendance
- Always check your balance before marking attendance
- Need more cards? Contact an administrator

### Balance can't go negative
- The platform prevents the balance from going below 0
- You can't mark attendance without at least one card

### Administrators manage cards
- Only administrators can add or remove cards
- Ask for more cards when you need them
- Administrators see all users' balances

## Tips for using cards smartly

1. **Plan ahead**: Sign up for trainings early, but mark attendance only when you're sure
2. **Keep track**: Check your balance regularly
3. **Cancel in time**: Can't make it? Cancel attendance as soon as possible
4. **Ask for more**: Contact administrator before you run out, not after

## Common questions

**Can I use someone else's vouchers?**
No, vouchers are personal and cannot be shared.

**What happens if I mark attendance by mistake?**
Cancel attendance immediately and you'll get the card back.

**Do I get cards back if I miss a training?**
Only if you marked attendance and then cancel it. Did you never mark attendance? Then no card is consumed.
