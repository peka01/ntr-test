# Voucher System

## What are vouchers?
Vouchers are credits that users spend to attend training sessions. Each training session costs 1 voucher.

## How do vouchers work?
- Users start with 0 vouchers (or a specified amount)
- Admins can add/remove vouchers from user accounts
- When a user attends a training, 1 voucher is deducted
- If attendance is cancelled, the voucher is refunded
- Vouchers cannot go below 0

## Voucher Rules:
- You cannot attend trainings without vouchers
- Vouchers are only spent when marking attendance
- Vouchers are refunded when cancelling attendance
- Contact an administrator to add vouchers to your account
