# Vouchers - Your Key to Trainings

## What are vouchers?

Vouchers work as a digital currency in the system. Think of them as tickets to trainings - each training costs one voucher. This system makes it easy to keep track of who participates in what, and gives administrators control over training usage.

## How it works in practice

### For new users
When you are created as a user, you start with 0 vouchers. This is normal - you need to have vouchers assigned by an administrator before you can attend trainings.

### Registration vs attendance
- **Registration is free**: You can register for as many trainings as you want without using vouchers
- **Attendance costs**: A voucher is only deducted when you actually mark attendance for a training

### Refunds
If you cancel your attendance to a training, you get your voucher back immediately. This gives you flexibility to change your mind without losing vouchers.

## Important rules to remember

### You need vouchers to participate
- Without vouchers, you cannot mark attendance
- Always check your balance before marking attendance
- If you don't have enough vouchers, contact an administrator

### Vouchers cannot go below 0
- The system prevents your balance from becoming negative
- You cannot mark attendance if you don't have at least one voucher

### Administrators manage vouchers
- Only administrators can add or remove vouchers
- Contact your administrator if you need more vouchers
- Administrators can see all users' voucher balances

## Tips for using vouchers effectively

1. **Plan your trainings**: Register for trainings in advance, but mark attendance only when you're sure you can attend
2. **Keep track of balance**: Check your voucher balance regularly
3. **Cancel in time**: If you can't attend, cancel attendance as soon as possible to get the voucher back
4. **Contact administrator**: Ask for more vouchers before you run out, not after

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I use vouchers from another user?**
No, vouchers are personal and cannot be transferred between users.

**What happens if I mark attendance by mistake?**
You can cancel attendance immediately and get the voucher back.

**Can I get vouchers back if I miss a training?**
Only if you marked attendance and then cancel it. If you never marked attendance, no voucher is consumed.

**Do I need to mark attendance right when the training starts?**
No, you can mark attendance anytime, but it's good to do it in advance so the trainer knows you're coming.

**What happens if I forget to mark attendance?**
If you don't mark attendance, no voucher is consumed, but the trainer won't know you participated.
