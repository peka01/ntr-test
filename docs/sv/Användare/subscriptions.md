## Overview

Want to join a training session? You can easily sign up here! It's completely free to sign up and gives you the chance to join when the time comes. Think of it as showing interest and booking your place.

## How it works

### What does a registration mean?
When you sign up, you show that you want to join the training. It's like 'holding a place' for you, without you having to promise anything. You just confirm that you are likely to come.

## Sign up for training sessions

### Here's how you do it
1. Go to **{{navPublic}}**
2. Look through the list of trainings
3. Read the description of each training and see if it is suitable for you
4. Click on **{{subSubscribeBtn}}** next to the training you want to join
5. Confirm that you want to sign up

### What you see for each training
- **Title and description**: What the training is about
- **Date and time**: When the training is
- **Location**: Where the training is held
- **Number of places left**: How many people can attend
- **Your status**: Whether you are already enrolled or not

## Manage your registrations

### See your registrations
- **{{navPublic}}**: Here you can see all trainings you are registered for
- **{{navAttendance}}**: Here you can see the status of each training
- **Overview**: You get a clear picture of which trainings you plan to attend

### Unsubscribe from trainings
It is very easy to cancel a training session. You can do it directly in the platform.

**How to cancel someone (as an administrator):**
1. Go to **{{navPublic}}**.
2. Locate the training in question.
3. Under **{{subSubscribedUsers}}**, find the person you want to unsubscribe.
4. Click on the **Trashcan icon** next to the person's name. You will see "{{unsubscribeTooltip}}" when you hover over the icon.

The person will be removed from the list immediately. No clips are consumed and the spot becomes available for someone else.

### What happens when you unsubscribe?
- You are removed from the participant list
- You keep all your clips
- You can sign up again if you want
- The place becomes available for others
