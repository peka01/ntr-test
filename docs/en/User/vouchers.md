# The training card - Your ticket to training sessions

## What is a training card?

Think of clip cards as tickets to training sessions - simple and clear. Each training session costs one card. It makes it easy to keep track of who's coming to what and gives you control over training usage.

## Here's how it works

### When you start
As a new user, you start with 0 punch cards. This is perfectly normal! You will receive cards from an administrator before you can participate in training courses.

### Registration versus check-in
- **Register for free**: Register for as many trainings as you want - no card is used
- **Check-in costs**: A card is drawn only when you actually mark check-in

### Get your card back
If you cancel your check-in, you get your card back immediately. It's that simple!

## Important rules

### You need a card to attend
- Without a card you cannot mark check-in
- Always check your balance before marking check-in
- Do you need more cards? Contact an administrator

### Balance cannot go negative
- The platform prevents the balance from going below 0
- You cannot mark check-in without at least one card

### Administrators manage cards
- Only administrators can add or remove cards
- Ask for more cards when you need them
- Administrators see all users' balances

## Tips for using cards in a smart way

1. **Plan ahead**: Sign up for training early, but only mark check-in when you're sure
2. **Keep track**: Check your balance regularly
3. **Cancel on time**: Can't make it? Cancel your check-in as soon as possible
4. **Request more**: Contact the administrator before it runs out, not after

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I use someone else's punch card?
No, punch cards are personal and cannot be shared.

**What happens if I mark check-in by mistake?
Cancel the check-in immediately and you will get the card back.

**If I miss a training session, will I get my card back?
Only if you marked check-in and then canceled it. Have you never marked check-in? Then no card will be used.
