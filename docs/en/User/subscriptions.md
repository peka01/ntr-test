# Register for Trainings

## Overview

Easily register for trainings that interest you. Registration is the first step and allows you to participate when the time comes. Think of it as showing your interest and 'reserving a seat'!

### Visual Design

The **{{navPublic}}** page is the public-facing page of the system and features a distinct visual design:

-   **Blue Color Scheme**: Uses blue tones to signify openness and easy access.
-   **Minimalistic Design**: A clean, modern look without unnecessary clutter.
-   **Enhanced Navigation**: The active navigation element has special blue styling.
-   **Visual Indicators**: A small blue dot appears next to the page title to highlight it as a public page.
-   **Consistent Design**: A unified experience, with all elements using the same blue color palette.

## How Things Work

-   **Flexibility**: Unsubscribe anytime, no strings attached.
-   **Overview**: Keep track of all the trainings you're interested in.
-   **Reminders**: Get notified about upcoming trainings you’ve registered for.
