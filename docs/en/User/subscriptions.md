# Register for trainings

## Overview

Easily register for trainings that interest you. That's the first step - registering is free and allows you to participate when the time comes.

### Visual design
**Anm√§lan** (Public Subscription Page) is the open page in the system and has a special visual design to make it clear that it's accessible to everyone:
- **Blue color scheme**: Uses blue colors to indicate openness and accessibility
- **Minimalistic design**: Clean and modern design without unnecessary elements
- **Enhanced navigation**: Navigation element has special blue styling when active
- **Visual indicators**: Small blue dot next to the page title to mark it as an open page
- **Consistent design**: All elements use the same blue color scheme for unity

## How things work

### What is a registration?
A registration means that you show interest in joining. It's like 'reserving a seat' - you show interest but don't commit to actually attending.

### Benefits of registering
- **Free**: There is no cost to register for a training session with us
- **Flexibility**: You can unsubscribe at any time
- **Overview**: You see all the trainings you are interested in
- **Reminders**: You remember which trainings are available

## Register for trainings

### Here's how you do it
1. Go to **{{navPublic}}**
2. Browse the available trainings
3. Read the description of each training
4. Click **{{subSubscribeBtn}}** next to the training you want to attend
5. Confirm your registration

### What you see for each training
- **Title and description**: What the training is about
- **Date and time**: When the training takes place
- **Location**: Where the training is held

### Unsubscribe from trainings
The unsubscription process is simple and can be done by any user on the platform, including administrators.

**How to Unsubscribe a User:**

3. In the **{{subSubscribedUsers}}** list, locate the user you want to remove.
4. Click the **trashcan icon** next to the user's name. A tooltip with the text "{{unsubscribeTooltip}}" will appear on hover.

The user is immediately removed from the subscription list. This action does not affect voucher balances and the spot becomes available for other users.

### What happens when you unsubscribe?
- You will be removed from the participant list
